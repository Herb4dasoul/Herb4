How to run
-------

In order to see your [Three.js](http://threejs.org) project on your own computer you have to run "localhost":

- Windows: You can use [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/), or any simple local server
- OSX: In terminal, go to your public/name/ folder and type: php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
- Linux: In terminal, go to your public/name/ folder and type: python -m SimpleHTTPServer
- Otherwise, you can try running Chrome with the flags --disable-web-security

Libraries
-------

[three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/), [TweenMax.js](https://greensock.com/tweenmax), [isMobile](https://github.com/kaimallea/isMobile)

Setup
-------

Everything we're working on will be automatically deployed online here: [https://classes.marpi.pl/camp/](https://classes.marpi.pl/camp/)

For everyone at the workshop, there is a folder with your name, in /public/ directory. After you point the server from previous step to it, you'll be able to see your project. After you commit any changes during class, the copy will appear on the main server, that will let you test it on your phone. 

Just make sure you edit only your personal project :)

See you soon
